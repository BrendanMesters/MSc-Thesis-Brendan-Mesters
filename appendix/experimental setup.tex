\chapter{Experimental Setup}
\label{appendix: experimental setup}

Some figures to show the setup by which the experiments were performed.
Note, the screen shown in \cref{figure: sensors up close} shows the same content as the screen visible in \cref{figure: system in use} while the system is running.
