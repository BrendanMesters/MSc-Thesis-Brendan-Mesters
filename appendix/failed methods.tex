\chapter{Failed Methods}
\label{appendix: failed methods}


This appendix describes the methods for algorithmic HPE that have been attempted, but did not succeed in producing good enough results.

\section{Torso Removing}
\label{appendix: failed methods - torso removing}

Briefly discuss the torso removal system and the lessons learned from that


\section{Cluster Based Tracking}
\label{appendix: failed methods - cluster based tracking}

Systems that tried to use clustering to get fewer but more important points.
The main concept, the arm can be seen as a set of 15 tennisball-sized clusters. 
If we can get a clustering algorithm to produce a significant number of those, we may be able to follow the arm (volumetric skeletal estimation-esque).

\textbf{Two systems}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 
Personal software clustering. (only has access to the output of the FMCW, as we did not have a debug board)
    \item 
   Firmware clustering would have access to all the internals, but we won't have as much control over it. (here we got the firmware "\textit{Mobile tracking}" \cite{ti_mmwave_firmware} from.
\end{itemize}
