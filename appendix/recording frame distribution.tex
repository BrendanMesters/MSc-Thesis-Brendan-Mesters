\chapter{Recording Frame Distribution}
\label{appendix: recording frame distribution}

The different recordings have a different number of frames in total, and will also use a different number of frames for the \textit{pre-configuration} step. 
The following table shows the exact number of frames used for \textit{pre-configuration} as well as the number of frames used for \textit{evaluation} (evaluation frames = total frames - preconfig frames).

The table will use a shorthand notation to refer to recordings.
Standard movement set recordings will be specified with 'std' while free play recordings will be specified with 'free'.
The user of which the recording is will be specified by 'usr\_xx'.
The specific recording will be specified with 'rec\_a/b'.
Examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item "\textbf{standard movement set} recording from \textbf{user 07} number \textbf{2 out of 3}" becomes "std usr\_07 rec\_2/3"
\item "\textbf{free play} recording from \textbf{user 52} number \textbf{1 out of 1}" becomes "free usr\_52 rec\_1/1"
\end{itemize}


\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Recording & Number of Pre-configuration frames & Number of Evaluation frames \\
    \hline
    (example) std usr\_63 rec\_1/3 & 118 frames & 1363 frames \\
     \hline
\end{tabular}
