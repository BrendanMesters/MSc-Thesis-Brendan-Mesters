Important rules for typesetting bibliography:

- Consistency: __all__ references must be typeset following the same style. Therefore, if one reference lists all authors---all other must as well, if one reference lists address of the conference---all other conference publications must list it as well; if one conference is named by the abbreviation---all other must be as well (exception to the rule is when you cite a conference which is not well known), etc. 
- no et al.: please list __all___ authors of a publication
- time: typesetting clear and __complete__ reference file takes time (unfortunately). However, good presentation makes your thesis pleasant to read!
- abbreviate journal titles if possible: IEEE has a official list of IEEE journal abbreviations (http://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/Journal-Titles-and-Abbreviations.pdf) while ACM does; However you can quickly check on the ACM journal website what the official abbreviation is
- do not copy bibtex files blindly---typeset it yourself: ACM- and IEEE-generated bibtex files contain many inconsistencies, therefore you would have to type these references yourself. Below you will find a reasonably good designed list of most popular reference types. Use them as a boilerplate and replace these fields from a bibfile you downloaded from the internet
- abbreviate months: bibtex can replace three letter month name with the right one---do not put these names in curly brackets 
- abbreviations in curly brackets: in titles abbreviations must be placed in curly brackets
- capitalize titles: always

    abstract="Point cloud source data for surface reconstruction is usually contaminated with noise and outliers. To overcome this deficiency, a density-based point cloud denoising method is presented to remove outliers and noisy points. First, particle-swam optimization technique is employed for automatically approximating optimal bandwidth of multivariate kernel density estimation to ensure the robust performance of density estimation. Then, mean-shift based clustering technique is used to remove outliers through a thresholding scheme. After removing outliers from the point cloud, bilateral mesh filtering is applied to smooth the remaining points. The experimental results show that this approach, comparably, is robust and efficient.",
