This century, we have seen computers become more and more integrated into our everyday environment, and as such, the user interfaces of the past might not be suitable for all these systems anymore.
Many systems are not a "dedicated tool" anymore, such as the home computer, but rather an integrated part of your environment, think smart lamps, or voice assistants.
It is not always practical to control these systems with dedicated and noticeable input devices, such as a keyboard, mouse, or tablet.
Many such systems use someone's smartphone as an interface, or use voice commands to control these devices, however, those are not the only options available.
This thesis provides an example interface to a musical application, which senses the user's body and reacts to its movement in a privacy-preserving manner.
Similar systems have been built before, using the same sensor technology, but these previous systems relied on deep learning models, which are prone to overfitting, may need extensive retraining in new environments, and require an impractical amount of training data to produce good results.
This thesis sets out to design a Human Pose Estimation (HPE) system, using a Millimeter Wave (MMWave) sensor, which relies solely on explainable, debuggable, and tunable algorithms.
