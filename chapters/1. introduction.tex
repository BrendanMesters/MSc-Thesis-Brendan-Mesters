% This thesis proposes such an interface, which perceives the user's pose through a Millimeter Wave (mmWave) radar, and uses that data to control a computer system.
% Similar systems have been built before, using the same sensor technology, but these previous systems relied on deep learning models, which are prone to overfitting, may need extensive retraining in new environments, and require an impractical amount of training data to produce good results.
% This thesis sets out to design a Human Pose Estimation (HPE) system, using an mmWave sensor, which relies solely on explainable, debuggable, and tunable algorithms.
