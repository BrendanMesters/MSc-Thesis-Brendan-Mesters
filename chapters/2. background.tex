This thesis aims to create an algorithmic interpretation method for the point clouds generated by \textit{millimeter wave radars} (\textbf{mmWave Radars}), which is both \textit{explainable} and \textit{tunable}.
This method will interpret data for the purpose of \textit{human pose estimation} (\textbf{hpe}), a task which has thus far only been explored with the use of \textit{deep learning} (\textbf{dl}) systems.
This chapter should provide sufficient background knowledge to understand this thesis and will provide a clear view of existing research which is related to the research question of this thesis.

% This thesis works with a specific sensor, the Millimeter Wave Radar (mmWave Radar), and tries to solve a specific problem, Human Pose Estimation (HPE). 
% This section aims to give readers the necessary knowledge on these subjects to be able to read and understand this thesis.
% Furthermore, we will discuss some of the current state-of-the-art systems for HPE using an MMWave radar.
