This thesis presents an \textit{explainable} and \textit{tunable} algorithmic interpretation method for the point clouds generated by millimeter wave radars (\textbf{mmWave Radars}).
This method will interpret data for human pose estimation (\textbf{hpe}), a task which has thus far predominantly been explored with the use of \textit{deep learning} (\textbf{dl}) systems.
This chapter establishes the necessary foundations for the rest of the paper.
% This chapter should provide sufficient background knowledge to understand this thesis and will give a clear view of existing research that is related to the research question of this thesis.

% This thesis works with a specific sensor, the Millimeter Wave Radar (mmWave Radar), and tries to solve a specific problem, Human Pose Estimation (HPE). 
% This section aims to give readers the necessary knowledge on these subjects to be able to read and understand this thesis.
% Furthermore, we will discuss some of the current state-of-the-art systems for HPE using an MMWave radar.
