\chapter{Tracking Method}
\label{chapter: tracking method}

The main goal of the thesis is to find a method for predicting \textit{where} a user's arms are located, from a pointcloud generated by a millimeter wave radar.
More specifically, it should tell us in what general \textbf{zone} the arm is currently present, this can be either: 
"low", where the user's arm points at the ground;
"middle", where the user's arm points out to the side;
or "high", where the user's arm points up to the sky.
These regions exist both for the left and for the right arm, and thus there are 6 different \textit{zones} which the system tries to predict.
There are, of course, some physical bounds on this model. 
A person can, for example, only have each arm in \textit{one zone}, that means the system will always output \textbf{one} \textit{left zone} (left low, left middle, or left high) and \textbf{one} \textit{right zone}.

To facilitate this zone detection, a standalone pipeline was built to handle both the communication with the FMCW and packet decoding, as well as the filtering, labeling, and interpretation of the data. 
This thesis discusses the latter part of this pipeline, which implements a noise filtering system and our interpretation algorithm.
The final system used by IAmMuse will be discussed in \cref{section: tracking method - data enhancement}
 and \cref{section: tracking method - data interpretation}.
The final pipeline for IAmMuse only arrived after a lot of different approaches had been explored and proved unfruitful.
These approaches are briefly discussed in Appendix \ref{appendix: failed methods}.

% After that, \cref{section: tracking method - different approaches} will discuss some of the earlier attempts, as well as reasoning why those might have failed.

% Why we use an initialization step.
Most of the explored approaches rely on some \textit{training data} of the user.
This training data gives context that is used during the testing.
Interpretation of mmWave data without this context is highly challenging due to the low point density, along with the noise percentage.
This reliance on training data could be remedied in the future by utilizing a greater understanding of these interpretation methods.
However, this thesis still uses training data as it aims to create that \textit{understanding of interpretation methods}.



% The IAmMuse system, as well as most of the failed approaches, uses a workflow where the final \textit{interpretation} system relies on an \textit{initialization} performed by the user.
% During the creation of IAmMuse, it was found that it was not feasible to interpret the MMWave data without any sort of context.
% Such an \textit{initialization} step may not be needed in the future, as the understanding of effective interpretation methods improves, these steps could feasibly be done in real time, during usage.
% However, creating such an understanding of effective methods to generate context from a pointcloud, does benefit greatly from a well-defined initialization step, for that reason, IAmMuse chose to use such an initialization step.
