\label{chapter: setup baseline dataset}

% Small introduction to the chapter,
% Briefly touch on reproducibility, comparisons with existing methods, etc.

This chapter will discuss the physical setup, the hardware used and the testing procedures in \cref{section: setup baseline dataset - testing setup}.
It will discuss the different types of data which where collected, and establish some general terminology to refer to those in \cref{section: setup baseline dataset - dataset}.
Lastly the comparison methods will be introduced, and a case for the specific comparison model will be made in \cref{section: setup baseline dataset - baseline analysis}.
Further analysis of this comparison will be done in \cref{chapter: evaluation}.
