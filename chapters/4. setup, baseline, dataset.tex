\section{Testing Setup}
\label{section: setup baseline dataset - testing setup}

Explain the type of room we took measurements in and why, also describe the sensors we use (fmcw + kinect)

Describe the test setup specifically, use photos and specify measurements (user stood at a distance of 2m)

Explain testing procedure, what did we tell the users.

\section{Dataset}
\label{section: setup baseline dataset - dataset}

Explain what data was collected, 

define some common terms used throughout other parts of the dataset and evaluation parts (two types of recordings, initialization data and evaluation data, etc)


\section{Baseline Analysis}
\label{section: setup baseline dataset - baseline analysis}

Argue why MARS was used as a comparative model

Describe the simplest training (trained on calib data)

Describe some other "more advantageous" trainings we could do for mars (all calib data, the MARS model itself, a fully representative section of the data).
