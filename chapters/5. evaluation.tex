\section{Baseline Analysis}
\label{section: evaluation - baseline analysis}

Show the results of mars trained on the calib data of ONLY that specific recording

\section{Larger Models}
\label{section: evaluation - larger models}

Describe the new MARS trained models we'll be evaluating, (\texttt{mars\_paper} and mars trained on \textbf{all} calib data)

Show their results, and explain why they perform badly (overfitting, non-representative data).


\section{IAmMuse vs Best MARS}
\label{section: evaluation - iammuse vs best mars}

Describe how we'll train the best MARS model we could make.

Show the acuracy results, discuss how it is better then the previous mars' but still worse then IAmMuse

Show the time-prediction diagram (showcasing the "stuttering" of mars)

Show that the lowpass MARS results still underperform.

Mention that, even when given all the tools we could, mars could not perform better then IAmMuse
