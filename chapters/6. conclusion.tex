\textbf{After thought/lookback on paper}

% motivation
Currently, the field of HPE is dominated by Deep Learning systems
Algorithmic approaches are new and far between, even though they can be very successful \cite{li2025acoustic}.
This paper explored the possibility of algorithmic HPE for mmWave radars.

% Question
To do this, a pipeline was set up for a musical application
The system specifically tries to predict an arm zone
Results were compared with a similarly sized DL model, MARS \cite{an2021mars}

% Results and limitations
Similar train/initialize data, MARS performs terribly
With good training data, it performs reasonably (though not good)
Limitation: MARS predicts skeletal estimate IAmMuse only arm zone
Scenario-specific solutions are not an inherent downside.
Limitation: In free-play users may have adjusted their exact arm position if they didn't get the note they wanted, making it so they could react to the feedback IAmMuse gave them, without them being able to react to the feedback of mars. (given the instability of mars I don't think this is a huge issue)
