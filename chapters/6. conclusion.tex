%\textbf{After thought/lookback on paper}

%     -[[ Motivation ]]-
% Why did we do this research
In the field of mmWave radar-based HPE, all published solutions use deep learning for data interpretation, which comes with an inherent cost.
Deep learning has two inherent costs: the need for large, representative training datasets and the known high energy costs of deep learning models.
Algorithmic solutions do not have these inherent costs and have been shown to work in other mmWave radar-based systems (\textbf{REFERENCES}).

\brendanLines

% motivation
Currently, the field of HPE is dominated by Deep Learning systems
Algorithmic approaches are new and far between, even though they can be very successful \cite{li2025acoustic}.
This paper explored the possibility of algorithmic HPE for mmWave radars.

% Question
To do this, a pipeline was set up for a musical application
The system specifically tries to predict an arm zone
Results were compared with a similarly sized DL model, MARS \cite{an2021mars}

% Why/What we found

% Results and limitations
Similar train/initialize data, MARS performs terribly
With good training data, it performs reasonably (though not good)
Limitation: MARS predicts skeletal estimate IAmMuse only arm zone
Scenario-specific solutions are not an inherent downside.
Limitation: In free-play users may have adjusted their exact arm position if they didn't get the note they wanted, making it so they could react to the feedback IAmMuse gave them, without them being able to react to the feedback of mars. (given the instability of mars I don't think this is a huge issue)
