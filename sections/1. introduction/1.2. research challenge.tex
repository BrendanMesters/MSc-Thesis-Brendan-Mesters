\label{section: introduction - research challenge}

In this thesis, we will explore the possibility of algorithmic interpretation methods of mmWave point clouds.
We will design a system which can predict the general position of a users arms, into one of three distinct regions, "low", meaning angled at ...., "middle", which is the region of angles ...., and high, given the region of angles ....

\textbf{Research Challenge}: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
    This thesis aims to design an effective algorithmic interpretation method of mmWave radar pointclouds for the purpose of human pose estimation.
    \item
    This interpretation method should be explainable, as well as tunable to changing situations
    \item
    This interpretation method should hold up, if not exceed early Deep Learning methods for similar purposes.
\end{itemize}
