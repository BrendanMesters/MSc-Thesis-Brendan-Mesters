\section{Objective}
\label{section: introduction - objective}

This thesis aims to produce an algorithmic system to interpret MMWave pointclouds for the purpose of human pose estimation. 
This will be done in the form of a proof-of-concept application, which will allow the user to make music by way of moving their arms around.

This system will then be used to analyze the feasibility and the practicality of algorithmic data interpretation for MMWave pointclouds.
These findings will then be used to argue either in favor, or against the usage of, and research into, algorithmic data interpretation for MMWave pointclouds.

% The goal of this research is to see if stochastic mmwave data interpretation methods can compete with DL-methods, due to reasons mentioned in \cref{section: introduction - research problem}.
% We also want to find out if stochastic methods might even outperform some DL methods in certain scenarios.
% Besides that, insights from this study could be used in pre-processing steps of DL methods and might increase their performance.
