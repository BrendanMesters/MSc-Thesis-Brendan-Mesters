Privacy-preserving interfaces will become more and more prevalent, as the world and public spaces in particular keep on digitizing.
Such systems should be robust, easy to deploy, efficient, and effective.
That's why it's important to seriously investigate the feasibility, pros, and cons of algorithmic data interpretation for MMWave radars.
This thesis will thus provide an important comparison of algorithmic and deep learning systems for this specific use case, such that researchers and engineers can be better informed on how they should build these interfaces of the future.

% The avenue of stochastic methods is as of yet unexplored, this means that there could be untapped potential, as such this research aims to shed light on the potential which lays there.
% Furthermore, DL models are known for their high power and resource consumption, both in training and in usage.
% Thus, a "just as good" or "good enough" stochastic solution could reduce power consumption, and allow these systems to be used on a wider range of hardware.
