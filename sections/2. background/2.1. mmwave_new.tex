%     -[[ What is an MMWave radar]]-
% - Broadly: Senses surroundings into a pointcloud (like a bat)
% - Uses mmWaves; this differs from other methods (camera, lidar) by: ....
% - inherent advantages seen in applications: ...
% - 

%     -[[ Briefly, how does it work ]]-
% - FMCW + chirps
% - Phase array + doppler = angles, distances and velocity
% - FFT FFT FFT = pointcloud
% - 

%     -[[ What are some of the characteristics we care about ]]-
% - Low density pointcloud
% - Instability left right
% - Noise
