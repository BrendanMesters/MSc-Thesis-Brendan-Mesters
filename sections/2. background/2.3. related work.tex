Generic point cloud algorithms

Early and more recent HPE methods (camera, wearable, wifi, mmwave)

DL vs algorithmic solutions

algorithmic mmWave/pointcloud solutions: DBSCAN, etc

HPE with mmwave (the DL systems, including mars)

Algorithmic HPE for mmWave pointclouds \textbf{does not yet exist}

\subsection{Current State of the Art}
\label{sub-section: background - related work - current soa}
Briefly mention some \textit{non-mmwave} HPE solutions, those using cameras and those using sensors, as well as their shortcomings (privacy/light situation and clunkiness of wearables, respectively).
Discuss the various SOA MMWave HPE sollutions, their strengths, weaknesses and shortcommings.
Also specify the strengths of Stochastic explainable systems over DL systems (tunable, testable, explainable, significantly lower need for training data), and setup a bridge to the scientific gap.
