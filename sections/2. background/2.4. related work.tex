%     -[[ MUSIC ]]-
% Establish broad context for the engineering challenge.
% Mention that new technology often drives new forms of expression.
% Transition to new technology: mmWave
New technologies often lead to new forms of expression.
The electronic piano/synthesizer is one of the first and most well-known examples of an instrument made possible by the technological innovations at the time.
The theremin is another well-known musical instrument that emerged from a new invention, among many other lesser-known examples \cite{mcglynn2014interaction}.
These new instruments brought with them a new wave of musical intrigue \cite{otto1968history} and musical expression.
%     -[[ MMW Music ]]-
mmWave radars are another such system that can be used for new innovative ways of expression, and have already been used for this purpose in a limited manner.
The currently existing tools for mmWave music generation work either through gestures \cite{juneja2024wavetune}, or by movement close to the sensor \cite{bernado2017o_soli_mio}.
% though these systems limit the user's freedom of expression with their input modality.
These systems only allow the user to change between pre-existing music tracks or to affect some variables in an audio effect, thus limiting the scope of musical expression.


%     -[[ mmWave SOA (broad) ]]-
% Give the context of what is happening with mmWave
% Mention the various systems its being used in
Numerous innovative research papers use mmWave radar technology.
Research into vital sign monitoring \cite{wang2022heartprint,wang2023here} and acoustic reconstruction \cite{li2025acoustic, lin2024highquality} both use mmWave radar for its ability to sense sub-millimeter-sized movements.
% Research into vital sign monitoring \cite{wang2022heartprint,wang2023here} uses mmWave radar for its ability to sense sub-millimeter-sized movements.
% This ability to capture small movements can also be used to capture sound through otherwise soundproof barriers \cite{lin2024highquality, li2025acoustic}.
Systems designed for sensing in public spaces use mmWave radar for its privacy-preserving nature
% Due to mmWave radars' privacy-preserving nature, it is also seeing a lot of use in sensing systems for public spaces.
These systems range from people counting and tracking systems \cite{zhao2019tracking, vaidya2024exploiting}, activity and gesture recognition systems \cite{sen2024multi-user, palipana2021pantomime}, through to object detection and classification systems \cite{qi2016pointnet, qi2017pointnet++, guan2020through}.

%     -[[ Algorithms vs Deep Learning ]]-
% Open the discussion of Algorithms vs DL
% Give the pros and cons of both sides
% Show some algorithmic SOA systems.
Most research into pointcloud interpretation uses Deep Learning over algorithmic methods, in spite of both having distinct advantages and disadvantages.
% This thesis is, for a large part, based on a comparison between deep learning methods and algorithmic methods, both of which have advantages and disadvantages.
A significant advantage of algorithmic systems is that they can be explicitly reasoned about and allow for precise configuration using well-specified input parameters.
% allow for explicit reasoning and concisely configure them using well-specified input parameters.
Conversely, Deep Learning models offer a remarkable ability to generalize, but suffer from having opaque inner workings.
%be reasoned about and configured clearly using input parameters.
Robust and established clustering algorithms already exist for pointcloud analysis, such as DBSCAN \cite{ester1996dbscan}.
Other problems are successfully tackled by both DL systems, as well as algorithmic systems, such as geometric labeling of pointcloud data \cite{poux2019voxel}, or audio reconstruction using mmWave radars \cite{li2025acoustic}.

%     -[[ mmWave HPE | the gap]]
% Discuss the current SOA in mmWave HPE.
% Introduce the GAP of algorithmic HPE.
Currently, there is a lack of research into algorithmic HPE methods using mmWave radars.
The vast majority of research in the field focuses either on deep learning interpretation models \cite{mars2021github, junqiao2025diffusion, sengupta2020mmpose} or on constructing data sets for those deep learning models \cite{brescia2023millinoise, su2025high_fidelity, cui2023milipoint}.
Algorithmic interpretation methods for mmWave data can match or even exceed the results of similar Deep Learning systems, thus it is worthwhile to explore algorithmic methods for mmWave HPE.
