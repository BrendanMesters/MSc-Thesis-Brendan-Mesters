\label{section: setup baseline dataset - testing setup}

%     [[ Hardware setup (chip, firmware, config ]]
% Describe the chip we used, the config we used on that chip, the reason for that choice, the specific config used.
% Also, describe the method for ground truth collection.
The mmWave radar used for this thesis was the IWR6843ISK by Texas Instruments.
The firmware which is used on this chip is the \textit{Mobile Tracker} firmware \cite{ti_mmwave_firmware}, in part chosen due to it producing a reasonable number of relatively representative points, and in part due to legacy reasons, which are further discussed in Appendix \ref{appendix: configuration in detail}.
Next to this, a Microsoft Kinect 2 was used to collect the ground truth.
To get a skeletal estimation from the Kinect, a code base by \citeauthor{kharche2019skeletal}\cite{kharche2019skeletal} was used.
This code base could record the skeletal estimation produced by the Kinect to a CSV file, with timestamps for each frame, making it a good choice for the ground truth.


%     [[ Hardware setup p2. ]]
% Discuss the specific firmware used, what the advantages and disadvantages are, and what other options we might have had.
% -- [ SKIP ] -- 

%     [[ Environment setup (mounting, space) ]]
Describe the room in which the tests were held, describe the positions for the various sensors, as well as the position of the user
Use photos, specify measurements/distances

% Testing procedure
Describe the testing procedure.
Describe the types of data that were collected and why,
Describe the way in which the user was guided.

% Explain the type of room we took measurements in and why, also describe the sensors we use (fmcw + kinect)

% Describe the test setup specifically, use photos and specify measurements (user stood at a distance of 2m)

% Explain the testing procedure, what did we tell the users?
