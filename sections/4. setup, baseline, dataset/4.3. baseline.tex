\label{section: setup baseline dataset - baseline analysis}

% Compare with a DL model
Bring up the point of comparison, 
Mention that we need a "baseline" for comparison.
A baseline should be a deep learning model, since all current SOA systems are DL.
The baseline should be a simple/early model, as IAmMuse is also a first exploration
Propose MARS as a good model for comparison.

Discuss MARS, the strengths and weaknesses according to its paper (single frame only, no temporality).
Describe that we will want to train it on our own data.
Briefly discuss the different training methods (single calib, all calib, MARS paper, standard to free, maybe partial standard).

For this, use a table with the different train test data sets.
Also, argue for each of these options, why they'd be interesting to look at.
Give a small "alleup" for evaluation.

% Argue why MARS was used as a comparative model


% Briefly describe the different training methods which will be discussed.
















% -- [ OLD ] --

% Describe the simplest training (trained on calib data)

% Describe some other "more advantageous" trainings we could do for Mars (all calib data, the MARS model itself, a fully representative section of the data).
