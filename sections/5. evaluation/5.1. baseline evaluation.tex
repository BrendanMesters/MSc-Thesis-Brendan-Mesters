\section{Baseline Analysis}
\label{section: evaluation - baseline analysis}

% Apples to Apples
Introduce the apples-to-apples setup,
Explain why training on the calibration of a single recording is the \textit{most fair assessment}.
Briefly explain the training parameters.

% Results
Show the results of the two systems.
Show the accuracy plots
Show a few particularly bad frames of the visual replay.

% Discussion
Discuss why this gives such a bad result.
Give a small reason why this may not be a fully fair comparison (MARS is trained once, IAmMuse gets initialized every time)
Introduce the next section.


%Show the results of mars trained on the calib data of ONLY that specific recording
