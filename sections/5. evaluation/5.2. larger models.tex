\section{Larger Models}
\label{section: evaluation - larger models}

% Larger models intro
Refer back to the issues of the last section
Propose two new models
MARS paper and all calibration.
Explain why these two are interesting to look at (original model, a version with the same number of input frames as the original MARS).

% Results MARS-paper
Show the results MARS paper, 
MARS-paper is just trained on different data (configuration, physical setup).
Mention that the config was not specified in the paper.
Bring up the issue of "overfitting" in DL models.

% Results MARS-All-calib
Show the results of all-calib
Discuss its unique "optimization strategy" of T-posing.
Touch on "unrepresentative data"
Touch on the "local minima" issue of DL models.
show images to support my statement (and maybe a diagram showing that T-posing indeed gives minimal loss)

% Discussion
Mention that, even with sufficient training data, DL models can perform poorly
Discuss the need for careful data-set construction
Discuss the need for data sets in the first place.


% Describe the new MARS-trained models we'll be evaluating, (\texttt{mars\_paper} and mars trained on \textbf{all} calib data)

% Show their results, and explain why they perform badly (overfitting, non-representative data).
