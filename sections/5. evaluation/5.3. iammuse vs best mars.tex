\section{IAmMuse vs Best MARS}
\label{section: evaluation - iammuse vs best mars}

% Describe how we'll train the best MARS model we could make.
The final set of MARS trained models which will be considered are those which are also trained on the \textit{usage data}.
Two models will be considered, the first one is trained on the usage data of all \textit{standard recordings} and is evaluated on the usage data of all \textit{free play} recordings.
In this way, the generalization of the standardized movement set to more realistic usage can be measured, since the free play recordings emulate that very well.
The second models which will be considered is trained on the \textit{first and second} standard recordings of each user, and evaluated on the \textit{third} standard recording of each user.
This gives a more general view of how well the system generalizes on very similar data.
The reason that the train-test split was made with the same users in both sets is to avoid a situation where an exceptional user (e.g. a very small one) is in the test set, but not in the train set. 
A sufficiently well created training set should account for it, thus the "best case scenario" for MARS should also have that present.


% Show the acuracy results, discuss how it is better then the previous mars' but still worse then IAmMuse


Show the time-prediction diagram (showcasing the "stuttering" of mars)

Show that the lowpass MARS results still underperform.

Mention that, even when given all the tools we could, mars could not perform better then IAmMuse
