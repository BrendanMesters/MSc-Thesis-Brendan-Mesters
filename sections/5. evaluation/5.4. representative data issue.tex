\section{Representative data issue}
\label{section: evaluation - representative data issue}

\textbf{IDEA}: \textit{See if a model trained on the data of the taller users, evaluated on the data of the shortest user performs significantly worse. Only do this section if that is the case}

% intro
Point back to representative data issues in section \cref{section: evaluation - larger models}
Discuss the often "hidden issues" with datasets, 
Discuss why this is less of an issue with "designed systems" (A researcher made explicit assumptions, instead of implicit, which are easier to scrutinize.

% Experiment proposal
Introduce the idea of a "length separation" in your data (test set vs actual users)
Clearly specify training and testing data.
Theorize about results

% Results
Show the results, 
Compare the results with those achieved in \cref{section: evaluation - iammuse vs best mars}
Show that the result is significantly worse
Also, look at the results of the small user vs the longer users for the IAmMuse system, and show that this pattern (of worse performance) is not present there.

% Discussion
Mention how it's indeed easy to "miss" some crucial part in DL systems.
Also mention how algorithmic systems can "relatively easily" patch their system.
