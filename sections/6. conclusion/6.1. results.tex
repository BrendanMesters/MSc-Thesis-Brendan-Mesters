% Quickly summarize the main findings which were discussed in \cref{section: discussion - implications}.

\section{Results}
\label{section: conclusion - results}

% recap
Briefly mention the core concepts of IAmMuse's system
Mention the research question again (DL vs algorithm)
Briefly mention the difference between "arm angle estimations" and "skeletal estimations", and the way we get arm angle estimations from both

% Results
Mention the failures of the simple systems, and thus their exclusion.
Briefly mention some error numbers, and show that, even with best attempts, IAmMuse outperforms MARS.
"Even with the most help possible IAmMuse outperformed"
If applicable mention \cref{section: evaluation - representative data issue}, and its findings

% Final verdict
IAmMuse outperforms a similar DL model in the problem space setup here.
Repeat our conclusion: (something along the lines of "Its good, but this is just the start, it should not be ignored")


% Mention how it outperforms a similar DL system (MARS), even if we try to help the DL system as much as possible.

% Mention the more limited scope of IAmMuse (arm position, as opposed to skeletal estimate).

% Quickly summarize findings: algorithmic interpretation works; its tunable and more stable;
