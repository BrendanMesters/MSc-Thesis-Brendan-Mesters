\section{Recommendations/Future work}
\label{section: conclusion - future work}
Depending on the results, I either want to encourage more research into stochastic MMWave interpretation, both in breath and scope. aka, people should try and make stochastic systems for more complex problems/different problems. And people should look further at optimizations in the current system, in firmware used, system tuning, and potential broadening.
An interesting problem would be to see if you can increase the amount of zones, and reduce them in size, in such a way that you have ~20 zones per side, and to then try and modify the system to still predict zones correctly.
This could be achieved with a kind of "decaying charge" (each step the zone loses a percentage of its value) and a kernel/distance based "charge addition" (each point gives value to multiple zones, depending on how "near to it" they are).
