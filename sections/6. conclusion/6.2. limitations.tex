% Simpler Problem space
IAmMuse estimates one of three "arm zones" per arm.
MARS (and most systems) create a skeletal estimation.
This is an inherently different problem.
Note that this simpler problem space is often not a concern for application-specific solutions.

% Translation issues
We did not use a DL model, which predicted "zones"
This added complexity may have caused MARS to perform worse.
