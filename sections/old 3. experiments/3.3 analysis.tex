\section{Analysis}
\label{section: experiments - analysis}
I want to discuss the training of the MARS model, both practical aspects, such as the data transformation needed to get \textit{MARS formatted data} from \textit{IAmMuse} formatted data.

I want to discuss the train/test split, my attempt to run it on the MARS weights, and my attempt to train my own weights and the logic behind those two.

I want to discuss how I transform from skeletal estimate to arm zones (which is done in the same way between the Ground truth and the MARS prediction).

I want to discuss the different metrics I use to compare the two systems (stability, correct positions (out of the 9 unique combinations), and general accuracy).

% I will discuss the ways in which I analyzed the data, and why I did that the way I did, for example, the different MARS models I used.
% Furthermore, I'll discuss how I used both the \textit{origional settings} used during data gathering, as well as rerunning it on some tweaked settings (for example, having the temporal filtering look at more frames, as participants moved their hands back and forth slower then I personally did), to provide a better "end user tuned" version.
% I'll also discuss my exact grading metric.
