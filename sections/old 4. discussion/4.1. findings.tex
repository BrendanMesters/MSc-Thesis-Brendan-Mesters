% \section{Analysis of the results}
% \label{section: discussion - analysis}
% I'll look at the raw numbers, the results of the system on its own. 
% If its interesting I will also split up the data from user to user, and between the different trials (e.g. trial 1 of all users; trial 2 of all users; trial 3 of all users).
% In this analysis I will also take care to look at "lag", for example, if a position was not predicted at all, thats a lot worse then if its predicted a few frames to late.

I will go over the findings that came forth from \cref{section: experiments - results}, and put them forth
