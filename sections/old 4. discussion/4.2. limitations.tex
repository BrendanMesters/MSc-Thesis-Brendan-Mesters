% \section{Comparison}

% Here I will compare the results of my system with the results of using MARS to predict the data.
% If interesting I will once again look at the various subcategories, between trials and between individual users.

\section{Limitations}
\label{section: discussion - limitations}

Discuss the limitations of the study, such as the simple problem space, the fact that data gathering took place in an optimal environment (though both MARS and IAmMuse benefited from this).

I want to talk about the fact that MARS is (in theory) a more general system, and that it may not have shown its full potential due to the amount of training data it had, though that \textbf{is} precisely one of the weaknesses as well.

I also want to mention that the results of users who have just been introduced to a system might not be representative of the general performance of that system after a few tries.
